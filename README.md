# Welcome to the Interest Calculator!

This web application helps you calculate compound interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.

## Features

- **Simple Interface:** Enter the amount, annual interest rate, and number of years to get the compounded amount.
- **Annual Compounding:** Calculates interest compounded annually.

## How It Works

1. **Amount:** Enter the initial amount of money (principal) you want to invest or borrow.
2. **Rate:** Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage). The calculator converts this to a decimal.
3. **Number of Years:** Enter the number of years the money will be invested or borrowed. The calculator uses the following formula for annual compounding:

   \[
   A = P(1 + r)^t
   \]

   Where:
   - \( A \) is the amount after interest.
   - \( P \) is the principal amount.
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).
   - \( t \) is the number of years.
