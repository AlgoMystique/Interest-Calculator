**Welcome to the Interest Calculator!**

This web application helps you calculate compound interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and number of years.

**Live Demo:** You can view the live demo of the Interest Calculator here - https://algomystique.github.io/Interest-Calculator

**Features:**

Simple Interface: Enter the amount, annual interest rate, and number of years to get the compounded amount.

Annual Compounding: Calculates interest compounded annually.

**How It Works:**

Amount: Enter the initial amount of money (principal) you want to invest or borrow.

Rate: Enter the annual interest rate (as a percentage). The calculator converts this to a decimal.

Number of Years: Enter the number of years the money will be invested or borrowed.
The calculator uses the following formula for annual compounding:

𝐴=𝑃(1+𝑟)𝑡A=P(1+r) t
 
Where:

A is the amount after interest.
P is the principal amount.
r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form).
t is the number of years.
